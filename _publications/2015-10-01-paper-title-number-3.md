excerpt: 'Resource management plays a crucial role in improving sum rate of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. However, the traditional resource management methods have considerable complexity, creating a huge challenge in computational efficiency. To handle this challenge, a resource management method is proposed based on a deep neural network (DNN). The key advantage of the method is that the DNN can perform in almost real-time resource allocation because it requires a very simple operation. In this paper, the resource management problem of the NOMA system adopting imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) technology at the receivers is studied, including the power allocation stage and the user scheduling stage. For power allocation stage, the generic fully-connected DNN is trained to approximate the power allocation of interior point method (IPM), which not only greatly improves the computational efficiency but also increases the sum rate of the system. Based on the allocated power, the user scheduling algorithm is performed to further increase the system sum rate. Finally, simulation results verify some performances of the proposed algorithms.'
